# Solving programming problems :keyboard:

-  This repository is meant to be the place where I post my solutions of the problems of Edabit, CodeWars, LeetCode etc. The purpose is to learn Typescript along the way, as well.

# Commands :computer:

-  npm run compile
-  npm start

-  To get an output for a certain file I could either run `npm run compile` using the typescript compiler `tsc` or use `npm start` since nodemon has the ability to work with .ts files as well.

-  the dist folder carry the compiled files, "translated" from .ts to .js by the `tsc` compiler.
